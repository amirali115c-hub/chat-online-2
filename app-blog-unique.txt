# The App Store Reality: Why 90% of Apps Die Within a Month

Walk into any startup office in America and you'll see the same scene. Developers hunched over screens. Designers perfecting icons. Managers asking "when will it launch?" Nobody asking "who will actually use this?"

Six months later? The app is live. Downloads are zero. The team celebrates with coffee and cake. Then comes the silence.

This is the app store reality. Thousands of apps launch daily. Most disappear within weeks.

The problem isn't bad developers. America has talented teams. The problem isn't lack of features. Many apps have too many features.

The real issue? Building without validation.

What I have noticed across different app projects is this: teams fall in love with their idea before testing it. They build for months without asking one simple question.

Who actually wants this app?

Successful apps start with research. They test concepts before writing code. They talk to potential users. They find out if people actually care.

The app stores are brutal. Users have zero patience. They download, glance for three seconds, and delete if confused.

Performance matters more than pretty screens. An app that crashes or lags loses users immediately. I have watched beautiful apps fail because they load slowly.

Marketing gets ignored by most app teams. They think "if we build it, they will come." They won't. The app stores are crowded. Without marketing, your app is invisible.

The businesses that succeed? They market before launching. They build audiences before building features. They validate demand before writing code.

The app world rewards the prepared. Not the passionate.
