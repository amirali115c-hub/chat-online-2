# Conversation Continuity System

## How It Works

### When You Come Back Online:
1. I will automatically read `conversation_continuity.md` first
2. Then I will ask: "Let's continue from where we left off. [Summary of last conversation] - What would you like to do next?"

---

## How I Save Conversations

After every significant exchange, I will update this file with:
1. **Date/Time** of the conversation
2. **Summary** of what we discussed
3. **Open Items** - things we were working on
4. **Next Steps** - what we planned to do next

---

## Example Format

```markdown
## Conversation - [DATE]

### Summary
- Discussed X
- Worked on Y
- Decided to Z

### Open Items
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Next Steps
1. Do this
2. Then that
```

## Current Status
See the section above: **Last Conversation Summary**
