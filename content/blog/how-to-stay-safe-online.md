Essential tips for protecting yourself while chatting with strangers online.

## 1. Protect Your Personal Information

Never share your:
- Full name and address
- Phone number
- Email address
- Social media profiles
- Financial information

## 2. Use a Username, Not Your Real Name

Create a unique username that doesn't reveal your identity. Don't use your real name, birth year, or other identifying information.

## 3. Be Cautious with Links

Never click on suspicious links shared by strangers. They may lead to phishing websites or malware.

## 4. Report Suspicious Behavior

If someone makes you uncomfortable, asks for personal information, or behaves inappropriately, use the report button immediately.

## 5. Trust Your Instincts

If something feels wrong, it probably is. End the conversation and block the user.

Stay safe and enjoy chatting responsibly!
