# 2026-02-13 - System Control Progress

## Task: Build stable browser control

### What Was Built:
1. leos-browser-control-v2.js - WebSocket-based CDP control (port 9876)
2. leo-cdp-connector.js - HTTP-based CDP control (port 9877)  
3. leos-puppeteer.js - Puppeteer connection

### Current Status:
- Brave browser running with debugging port 9222
- OpenClaw extension shows Gmail tabs (Inbox + Compose)
- Connection unstable - gateway keeps dropping

### Files Created:
- leos-browser-control-v2.js
- leos-puppeteer.js  
- leo-cdp-connector.js
- leo-browser-server.js
- Various helper scripts

### What Works:
- Browser is running
- Gmail is accessible
- Extension connects intermittently

### What's Not Working:
- Commands timeout frequently
- Gateway connection unstable
- Hard to maintain persistent control

### User's Goal:
- Control browser to send emails
- Find and apply to copywriting jobs
- Use full system capabilities

### Recommendation:
Need to either:
1. Fix OpenClaw gateway stability
2. Or use manual email sending with templates

## Later Update (18:50)

### Additional Attempts:
1. Restarted OpenClaw gateway - didn't help
2. Tried multiple browser commands - all timed out
3. OpenClaw extension shows Gmail tabs but cannot control them

### Root Cause:
- WebSocket connections to browser are unstable
- Gateway service drops frequently
- Need more robust solution

### Current State:
- Browser running on port 9222 (Brave)
- API servers running on ports 9876, 9877
- Gmail is open but cannot control

### User Notified:
- Told user about instability
- Asked for next steps
- Waiting for response

### Key Files:
- leos-browser-control-v2.js (main attempt)
- leos-puppeteer.js
- leo-cdp-connector.js
- leo-browser-server.js
- freelance-opportunities.md (job leads)
- companies-to-email.md (pitch templates)

## Final Status (19:00)

### What Works:
- Gmail is logged in (amircontentwriter@gmail.com)
- Browser control connects intermittently (1-2 commands then drops)
- Can get snapshots occasionally

### Root Cause:
- OpenClaw gateway WebSocket connections are unstable
- Connection drops after 1-2 commands
- Cannot maintain persistent browser control

### Pattern Observed:
1. Open new tab → works
2. Get snapshot → works  
3. Click button → usually fails/times out
4. Connection lost

### What I Tried:
- Multiple CDP scripts
- Restarting gateway
- Different browser (Brave)
- Opening new tabs
- All result in same instability

### Conclusion:
The OpenClaw extension/gateway itself has stability issues. Need either:
1. Fix OpenClaw configuration
2. Use manual email sending for now
