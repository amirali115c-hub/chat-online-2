## SECTION 1: HEADLINE MASTERY

### Best Headlines from Top Brands

| Brand | Headline | Why It Works |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Apple | "Say hello to the latest generation of iPhone" | Simple, benefit-focused, product as hero |
| Apple | "There's still time to get gifts they'll love" | Emotional, timely, benefit-first |
| Nike | "Just Do It" | Iconic, action-oriented, aspirational identity |
| Nike | "Show them your true nature when you step on the court" | Emotional, identity-driven |
| Nike | "Take your cutthroat conviction off the court" | Aspirational, powerful verbs |
| Nike | "Make a name and disrupt traditional gameplay" | Power words, identity |
| Shopify | "Sell online and in person. Sell locally and globally." | Rhythm, all-encompassing |
| Shopify | "Start selling in no time" | Benefit-first, action-oriented |
| Airbnb | "Vacation rentals, cabins, beach houses, & more" | Specific, benefit listing |
| Airbnb | "It's easy to start hosting and earn extra income" | Benefit + ease |
| Stripe | "Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue" | Authority, benefit |
| Stripe | "The backbone of global commerce" | Powerful metaphor, authority |

| Dropbox | "Find anything. Protect everything." | Rhythm, two-part promise |
| Slack | "Move faster and work smarter" | Benefit-driven, action verbs |
| Notion | "More productivity. Fewer tools." | Contrast, benefit |

### Headline Rules (From Fortune 500)

1. **Keep it short** - 3-7 words typically
2. **Lead with benefit or emotion** - Not features
3. **Use powerful verbs** - "Move faster", "Find", "Protect"
4. **Create rhythm** - Parallel structure works
5. **Make it feel inevitable** - Subhead explains headline
6. **Use contrast** - "More X, Fewer Y"
7. **Be specific** - "97 min" beats "save time"
8. **Aspirational identity** - Who does the user become?

## SECTION 2: SUBHEADLINE FORMULA

### How Top Brands Do Subheads

**Apple:**
- Subhead expands on headline benefit
- "The ultimate way to watch your health" (expands on Apple Watch)
- "Supercharged by M5" (simple power statement)

**Stripe:**
- Massive numbers build authority
- "99.999% historical uptime"
- "$1.4T in payments volume processed in 2024"

**Shopify:**
- Three-part structure: "Sell online and in person. Sell locally and globally. Sell direct and wholesale."
- Numbers: "$1,000,000,000,000 in sales"

**Slack:**
- Problem → Solution structure
- "97 min average time users can save weekly with AI in Slack"

### Subhead Rules

1. Support the headline - answer "so what?"
2. Add specific proof/numbers
3. Use social proof naturally
4. Keep benefit at the center

---

## SECTION 3: CTA (CALL TO ACTION) MASTERY

### Best CTAs from Top Brands

| Brand | CTA | Psychology |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Stripe | "Get started" | Simple, frictionless |
| Shopify | "Get a stunning store" | Benefit-focused |
| Airbnb | "Become a host" | Identity-based |
| Slack | "Try for free" | Low barrier |
| Notion | "Try for free" | Risk reversal |
| Netflix | "Watch now" | Action-oriented |
| Apple | "Learn more" / "Buy" | Direct |

### CTA Rules

1. **Start with action verbs** - Get, Try, Start, Watch, Become
2. **Benefit over feature** - "Get a stunning store" not "Sign up"
3. **Low friction** - "Start now", "Try free"
4. **Identity-based** - "Become a host", "Join the team"
5. **Specific when possible** - Direct and clear

---

## SECTION 4: SENTENCE STRUCTURE

### Patterns from Top Brands

**Short is king:**
- Apple: "Say hello to the latest." (3-5 words common)
- Nike: "Just Do It." (3 words)
- Dropbox: "Find anything. Protect everything." (2 sentences, parallel)

**The "So What?" Test:**
Every sentence must pass:
- Does it benefit the reader?
- Does it move the story forward?
- Would a human say it this way?

**Varied rhythm:**
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- "It all starts with a channel." (short)
- "Channels are flexible, transparent spaces for working with your team, AI assistants, and agents." (longer)

**Active over passive:**
- "Find anything. Protect everything." (active)
- "Security never comes second." (active)

---

## SECTION 5: "YOU" VS "WE" ANALYSIS

### The Winning Ratio

Top brands heavily favor "YOU":
- Nike: "Show THEM your true nature" → "Take YOUR cutthroat conviction"
- Shopify: "YOUR store", "YOUR business"
- Slack: "YOUR team", "YOUR work"
- Dropbox: "YOUR work", "YOUR team"

### Rule: Flip "We" to "You"

| Instead of... | Write... |
|--------------|----------|
| We offer... | You get... |
| We provide... | You have access to... |
| We help... | You can... |
| Our features... | Your benefits... |

---

## SECTION 6: SPECIFICITY SELLS

### Vague vs Specific

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| Many customers | 4,000+ leading organizations |
| Fast | in seconds |
| Save time | save 97 minutes per week |
| High uptime | 99.999% historical uptime |
| Lots of users | 150M+ active subscriptions |
| Trusted by companies | Trusted by top teams |

### Specificity Rules

1. Numbers beat words
2. "97 min" > "a lot of time"
3. "$1.4T" > "billions of dollars"
4. "62% of Fortune 100" > "many Fortune companies"
