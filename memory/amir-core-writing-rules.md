**Priority: ABSOLUTE**

**Status:** MUST FOLLOW OR GENERATE NOTHING

## **THE THREE PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS (BANNED)**

### 1. Question + Sympathy Bridge + Statement
**BANNED:**
```
"Have you felt...? You are not alone. Many business owners..."
```
**Why:** Too formulaic, copywriting trick, feels manufactured

### 2. Parallel Sentence Pairs
**BANNED:**
```
"Referrals are powerful. Happy customers recommend you to others."
(5 words + 5 words = perfectly balanced)
```
**Why:** AI creates symmetrical sentences, no human imperfection

### 3. List-Like Imperative Commands
**BANNED:**
```
"Strategic partnerships help. Partner with complementary businesses. 
Refer customers to each other."
(4 words + 4 words + 4 words = bullet points)
```
**Why:** Reads like instructions, no natural flow

---

## **THE THREE SOLUTIONS (MANDATORY)**

### Solution 1: Question with Context
**USE INSTEAD:**
```
"In the UAE, ad spend is disappearing for many businesses. 
Have you felt this happening? It is a common problem."
```
**Why:** Context first, then question, then expansion - natural flow

### Solution 2: Explanation with Connectors
**USE INSTEAD:**
```
"Referrals are powerful. This works because happy customers 
recommend you to others. And people trust recommendations."
```
**Why:** First sentence, then explanation, then connector - varied structure

### Solution 3: Conditional Flow
**USE INSTEAD:**
```
"Strategic partnerships help. When businesses partner with 
complementary ones, they can refer customers to each other. 
This creates a win-win situation."
```
**Why:** First statement, then conditional, then result - natural progression

## **BEFORE GENERATING - CHECKLIST**

### Step 1: Identify Structure
- [ ] Does it have Question + Bridge + Statement?
- [ ] Does it have parallel sentences (same length)?
- [ ] Does it have list-like imperatives?

### Step 2: Apply Solutions
- [ ] If Question + Bridge → Add context first
- [ ] If parallel sentences → Add connector, vary length
- [ ] If list-like → Add conditional, explain result

### Step 3: Read Aloud
- [ ] Does it sound like natural conversation?
- [ ] Are sentence lengths varied?
- [ ] Are there connectors between related sentences?

## **HUMAN vs ROBOTIC REFERENCE**

### Robotic (AVOID):
```
"Have you felt...? You are not alone. Many business owners..."
"Referrals are powerful. Happy customers recommend..."
"Partner with X. Refer to Y. Grow Z."
```

### Human (USE):
```
"In the UAE, ad spend is disappearing. Have you felt this?"
"Referrals are powerful. This works because happy customers 
recommend you. And people trust recommendations."
"Strategic partnerships help. When businesses partner with 
complementary ones, they refer customers to each other."
```

## **THE GOLDEN RULE**

> **IF IT READS LIKE A COPYWRITING FORMULA, IT IS WRONG.**
> **IF IT READS LIKE A NATURAL CONVERSATION, IT IS RIGHT.**
