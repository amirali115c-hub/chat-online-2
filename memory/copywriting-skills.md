# Copywriting Skills - STRICT RULES

These skills are from TWO sources:
1. Brand analysis (Dollar Shave Club, Headspace, Nike, Apple, etc.)
2. Fortune 500 analysis (Shopify, Stripe, Slack, Netflix, Notion, Airbnb, Dropbox, HubSpot, etc.)

These skills MUST be followed 100% for every piece of copy. If I cannot follow these rules, I must tell Amir: "I can't write this."

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Human Over AI
- Write like a human talking to a friend, not a corporation shouting
- Avoid robotic, formulaic language
- Include calculated vulnerability and imperfection
- Sound like a confident expert, not a marketing machine

### 2. Benefits Over Features
- Never list features first
- Translate every feature into a benefit
- Answer "So what?" until you reach the core benefit

### 3. Second-Person Dominance
- Use "you" and "your" far more than "we" or "our"
- Flip "We do X" to "You get X"

### 4. Specificity Sells
- Replace vague words with specific numbers
- "Many customers" → "4,000+ leading organizations"
- "Fast" → "in seconds"
- "Save time" → "save 97 minutes per week"

## HEADLINE RULES

### 5. The 5-Minute Headline Sprint
- Write 20 headlines in 5 minutes
- Don't edit - quantity first
- Pick the best 3

### 6. Headline Formula
- 3-5 words when possible
- Benefit-driven, not feature-driven
- Make the subhead feel inevitable

### 7. Headline Examples to Study
- "Find anything. Protect everything." (Dropbox)
- "Share it. Discuss it. Get it done." (Slack)
- "Stress less" (Headspace)
- "Just Do It" (Nike)

## OPENING HOOKS

### 8. Types of Hooks
- **Problem-aware:** "Escape the clutter and chaos"
- **Benefit-first:** "Sharper blades. Smoother shaves. Better prices."
- **Question-based:** "What kind of headspace are you looking for?"

## COPY STRUCTURE

### 9. The "So What?" Test
- After writing any paragraph, ask "So what?"
- Cut every sentence that fails this test

### 10. Voice Calibration
- Read copy out loud
- Does it sound like a human talking to a friend?
- If not, rewrite

### 11. Friction Identification
- List every reason someone might NOT buy/click/sign up
- Address each objection in your copy

### 12. Rhythm Variation
- Short sentences mixed with longer ones
- Read with emphasis on different words
- Meaning shouldn't change, but feeling should

## THE HUMAN ELEMENT (AI CAN'T REPLICATE)

### 13. What AI Cannot Fake
- Specific lived experiences
- Calculated vulnerability
- Cultural timing and references
- The right amount of imperfection
- Audience-specific calls-to-action

### 14. Brand Voice Examples
- **Apple:** Minimalist, confident simplicity
- **Nike:** Emotion-driven, aspirational identity
- **Dollar Shave Club:** Conversational, irreverent humor
- **Slack:** Problem-solution, data-backed
- **Headspace:** Empathetic, supportive

## PRACTICE RULES

### 15. Daily Practice
- Write 10 headlines for any project before checking email
- Create "feature → benefit → emotion" worksheets

### 16. Editing Rules
- Audit for vague terms → replace with specific alternatives
- Count sentences starting with "We" → flip to "You"
- Cut anything that doesn't serve the reader

---

## WHEN TO SAY NO

### 17. If I Cannot Follow These Rules
- Tell Amir: "I can't write this"
- Explain which rule I cannot meet
- Do not compromise
