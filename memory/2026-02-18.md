## Copywriting System Enhancements

### THE ULTIMATE SEO CONTENT MASTERY PROMPT v2.0
Complete 9-phase SEO content system saved to:
- memory/ultimate-seo-content-mastery-prompt.md (11KB)

Includes:
- Semantic SEO + HCU + E-E-A-T compliance
- Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) mapping
- Undetectable human writing (5-15% AI detection)
- 95%+ contractions requirement
- Complete banned language list

### Competitor Entity Analysis (NEW)
Added to Phase 1 and Phase 8:
- Must analyze competitor content before writing
- Find entity GAPS competitors miss
- Cover MORE entities than competitors (10-15 vs 3-5)
- Cover MORE attributes than competitors
- Beat competitors on depth

### Priority System Established
1. SEO Master Prompt - for SEO content
2. Writing Soul - for voice/tone
3. Writing Bible - for non-SEO content
4. Complete Checklist - for details
5. Copywriting Skills - for techniques

### CRITICAL RULE (Added to SOUL.md, USER.md, COPYWRITING_REMINDER.md)
**COMBINE BOTH SYSTEMS - NEVER USE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER**

For ALL content (SEO, blog, email, copywriting, landing page, service page):
1. SEO Structure - from ultimate-seo-content-mastery-prompt.md
2. Amir's Voice - from amir-writing-soul-strict.md + amir-writing-bible.md

Example:
- SEO requires: Semantic keywords, H2/H3 structure, FAQ section
- Amir's Voice requires: "I've seen this fail..." "And honestly? Wasted."
- Combined = SEO STRUCTURE + AMIR'S VOICE

### Files Updated
- SOUL.md - Added CRITICAL COPYWRITING RULE at top

## Entities, Topics, Intent - How to Build Rich Content That Ranks

### The Trio Explained

**1. ENTITY**
- The main thing being written about
- Recognized by Google's Knowledge Panel
- Example: "email marketing"
- Related entities: autoresponder, drip campaign, list segmentation
- Attributes: "how to", "best tools", "examples", "cost"

**2. TOPIC**
- The broader area you dominate
- Primary entity + ALL related entities
- Semantic keyword clusters around entities
- Deep coverage = topical authority

**3. INTENT**
- Why someone searches
- Informational: "what is email marketing"
- Commercial: "best email marketing tools"
- Transactional: "email marketing software pricing"

### Strategy for Ranking

**Step 1:** Pick primary entity
**Step 2:** Map 10-15 attributes around it
**Step 3:** Find 8-12 related entities
**Step 4:** Check what competitors MISS
**Step 5:** Cover MORE and BETTER than them
**Step 6:** Match intent with structure

### Content Depth Rule

**Competitors cover:** 3 entities, 5 attributes

**I cover:**
- 12 entities (vs 3)
- 15 attributes (vs 5)
- All 4 intent types
- Personal experience throughout

**Result:** Outrank them on depth.

### Before Writing ANY Content

1. Identify entities competitors miss
2. Cover MORE entities than them
3. Cover MORE attributes than them
4. Match search intent perfectly
