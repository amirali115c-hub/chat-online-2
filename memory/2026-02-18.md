## Copywriting System Enhancements

### THE ULTIMATE SEO CONTENT MASTERY PROMPT v2.0
Complete 9-phase SEO content system saved to:
- memory/ultimate-seo-content-mastery-prompt.md (11KB)

Includes:
- Semantic SEO + HCU + E-E-A-T compliance
- Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) mapping
- Undetectable human writing (5-15% AI detection)
- 95%+ contractions requirement
- Complete banned language list

### Competitor Entity Analysis (NEW)
Added to Phase 1 and Phase 8:
- Must analyze competitor content before writing
- Find entity GAPS competitors miss
- Cover MORE entities than competitors (10-15 vs 3-5)
- Cover MORE attributes than competitors
- Beat competitors on depth

### Priority System Established
1. SEO Master Prompt - for SEO content
2. Writing Soul - for voice/tone
3. Writing Bible - for non-SEO content
4. Complete Checklist - for details
5. Copywriting Skills - for techniques

### CRITICAL RULE (Added to SOUL.md, USER.md, COPYWRITING_REMINDER.md)
**COMBINE BOTH SYSTEMS - NEVER USE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER**

For ALL content (SEO, blog, email, copywriting, landing page, service page):
1. SEO Structure - from ultimate-seo-content-mastery-prompt.md
2. Amir's Voice - from amir-writing-soul-strict.md + amir-writing-bible.md

Example:
- SEO requires: Semantic keywords, H2/H3 structure, FAQ section
- Amir's Voice requires: "I've seen this fail..." "And honestly? Wasted."
- Combined = SEO STRUCTURE + AMIR'S VOICE

### Files Updated
- SOUL.md - Added CRITICAL COPYWRITING RULE at top
- USER.md - Added copywriting priority rule
- COPYWRITING_REMINDER.md - Updated with COMBINE BOTH SYSTEMS
- memory/ultimate-seo-content-mastery-prompt.md - Added competitor entity analysis
- memory/2026-02-18.md - This file (daily memory)
