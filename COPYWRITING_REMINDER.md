# COPYWRITING REMINDER - READ THIS FIRST

**Priority: MANDATORY**
**When user mentions: "copywriting", "write", "content", "blog", "landing page", "SEO", "email", "service page"**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE - COMBINE BOTH SYSTEMS

**ALWAYS combine both systems - NEVER use one without the other:**

### 1. SEO Structure (from ultimate-seo-content-mastery-prompt.md)
- Semantic keywords
- Entity-Attribute-Value mapping
- HCU compliance
- Schema-ready content
- H2/H3 headings, FAQ section

### 2. Amir's Voice (from amir-writing-soul-strict.md + amir-writing-bible.md)
- Personal experience: "I've seen..."
- Honest frustration, no sugarcoating
- Fragments for impact: "And most of it? Wasted."
- 95%+ contractions (don't, can't, I've, it's)
- Casual starters: Look, So, And, But, Well
- Simple contrasts: "Their budgets grow. Their results do not."

---

## Quick Rules (Always Follow)

### ❌ NEVER USE:
- Formal connectors: "Despite", "Nevertheless", "Furthermore", "Moreover"
- Academic language
- Problem listing
- Question + Bridge + Statement
- Parallel sentence pairs
- AI phrases: "unlock potential", "delve into", "game-changer", "holistic approach"

### ✅ ALWAYS USE:
- Personal experience: "I have seen...", "I have talked to..."
- Honest frustration: Direct, no sugarcoating
- Simple contrasts: "Their budgets grow. Their results do not."
- Fragments for impact: "And most of it? Wasted."
- Summary statements at end
- 95%+ contractions (don't, can't, I've, it's)

### 📝 OPENING FORMULA:
```
[Start mid-thought + fragment + personal experience + escalating fragments]
[Honest observation + contrast + summary]
```
