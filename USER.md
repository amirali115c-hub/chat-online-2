## 🚨 CRITICAL COPYWRITING RULE

**When user asks for SEO, blog, email, copywriting, landing page, service page:**

> **COMBINE BOTH SYSTEMS - NEVER USE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER**

1. **SEO Structure** (from ultimate-seo-content-mastery-prompt.md)
   - Semantic keywords, entities, HCU compliance, schema-ready

2. **Amir's Voice** (from amir-writing-soul-strict.md + amir-writing-bible.md)
   - Personal experience ("I've seen...")
   - Honest frustration, no sugarcoating
   - Fragments for impact
   - 95%+ contractions
   - Casual sentence starters (Look, So, And, But...)
   - Simple contrasts
