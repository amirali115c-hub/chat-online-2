# How a UAE SME Went From Coming Soon to a Homepage That Actually Sells

Let me tell you about a client I worked with not long ago. A small and medium enterprise based in the UAE. They had been working on their AI content for months. And by working on it, I mean they had a coming soon page and a promise to launch soon. That was their entire web presence. Coming soon. That is it. No content. No homepage. No conversion funnel. Just hope and a promise.

They had AI tools. They had prompt libraries. They had everything they thought they needed. But they were stuck. Overwhelmed by options. Confused by conflicting advice. And paralyzed by the fear of getting it wrong. So they did what a lot of businesses do. They waited. They kept tweaking their prompts. They kept researching best practices. And their website stayed in coming soon mode for six months.

Sound familiar? I see this all the time. Businesses that have all the tools but no direction. They know they need content. They know AI can help. But they have no system. No strategy. And no clarity on what their homepage should actually say.

## The Before Picture

When I first looked at their situation, the problem was clear. They had too many messages trying to say too many things. They were a marketing agency. Or were they a technology consultancy? Or were they a business consulting firm? Their website, such as it was, tried to be all three. And as a result, it was none of them.

Their AI prompts reflected this confusion. They were asking AI to write content that appealed to everyone. And AI, being the helpful tool it is, did exactly that. Generic content that said nothing specific. Content that had the right words but the wrong energy. Content that could have been for any business in any industry.

The coming soon page was the symptom. The disease was unclear positioning. Until they knew what they really sold, no AI tool could help them write it. And that was the first conversation we had.

## The Transformation

We spent two hours just defining what they actually did. What problem did they solve? For who? And what made them different? Those three questions took two hours. Because they had never answered them clearly before. They had assumptions. They had hopes. But they did not have clarity.

Once we had that clarity, everything changed. AI suddenly became useful. Because now we had a specific direction. We knew what voice to use. We knew what message to communicate. And AI helped us draft that message faster than we could have written it ourselves.

The homepage that took them six months to not finish? We completed it in two days. Two days of focused work instead of six months of scattered effort. And the difference was not the AI tool. The difference was knowing what to ask for.

## The Spirit of the Change

Now let me tell you what that homepage actually said. No numbers. No statistics. Just a clear message about what they did and who they served. It said, we help technology companies in the UAE build marketing systems that actually work. That is it. No fluff. No jargon. No trying to be everything to everyone.

And that simplicity was powerful. Because when a technology company in the UAE landed on that page, they knew immediately. Is this for me or not? If yes, they read on. If no, they left. And that was exactly what we wanted. Quality over quantity. Qualified leads over random traffic.

The client told me something that stuck with me. Before, they were trying to cast the widest net possible. Now they were speaking directly to their people. And their people were responding.

## What We Did Not Include

One thing we did not include on that homepage was the typical corporate speak. We did not say things like we deliver innovative solutions for forward thinking organizations. We did not say we leverage cutting edge technology to drive transformational growth. That kind of language is everywhere. It means nothing. And it converts no one.

Instead, we used specific language. Concrete claims. Direct statements about what we actually do. And that was radical. That was different from everything their competitors were saying. And that difference is what made it work.

The coming soon page was gone. In its place was a homepage that actually said something. That actually communicated value. That actually converted visitors into leads. And that was the transformation.

## The Lesson Here

The lesson here is not about AI. The lesson is about clarity. AI is a tool. It amplifies what you already have. If you have clarity, AI helps you express it faster. If you have confusion, AI helps you express your confusion faster too. The tool does not fix your positioning. You have to fix your positioning first.

So before you ask AI to write your homepage, ask yourself these questions. What do we actually sell? Who is it for? And what makes us different? If you cannot answer those three questions in one sentence each, AI cannot help you. Not yet. Get clear first. Then let AI help you express that clarity.

And if you need help getting clear, that is what I do. I help businesses go from confused to clear. From scattered to focused. From coming soon to actually selling. And if that sounds like what you need, we should talk.
