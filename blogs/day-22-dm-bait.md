# If Your Website Still Has Lorem Ipsum or a Coming Soon Vibe, Send Me Your URL

Here is a quick offer. If your website looks unfinished. If it has placeholder text where real copy should be. If it has that coming soon vibe that tells the world you are not quite ready. I want to see it. Send me your URL. Send me three bullet facts about your niche. And I will send you back something valuable.

## What I Need From You

Send me your website URL. Just the link. And send me three bullet points about what your business actually does. What problem do you solve? Who do you help? What makes you different? Keep it brief. Three bullets. That is all I need.

I do not need your entire brand strategy. I do not need a brief document. I do not need to schedule a call. Just the URL and three bullets. And I will do the rest.

## What I Will Send Back

Within 24 hours, I will send you three things.

First, a mini hook. A single sentence that captures what you do in a way that makes people stop scrolling. Something memorable. Something specific. Something that sounds like a real brand.

Second, one punchy service line. Not generic service descriptions. Not corporate jargon. A line that tells people exactly what you do and why it matters.

Third, one improved call to action. Not click here to learn more. Something that creates urgency. Something that tells people exactly what to do next.

## Why I Am Making This Offer

Because I see so many websites that are almost there. They have good products. They have real expertise. They have businesses that could be growing. And they are held back by copy that does not work. Copy that sounds generic. Copy that does not convert.

I want to help. And this is a low friction way to start. No commitment. No sales call. Just three things that might improve your website immediately.

## How to Take Me Up on This

Send me a message. Include your website URL. Include three bullet points about your business. And use the subject line: Website Audit. I will respond within 24 hours with your three items.

This is not a sales pitch. This is not a lead generation scheme. This is me offering help to businesses that need it. Because your website should not have lorem ipsum forever. It should have real copy that converts. And that is what I am going to help you with.

## The Catch

There is no catch. Really. I am not going to follow up with a sales call. I am not going to add you to a drip campaign. I am not going to sell your information to anyone. I am just going to send you three useful things for your website.

If those things are helpful and you want to work with me further, great. If not, you still have three improvements to your website for free. Either way, you win.

So what do you have to lose? Send me your URL. Send me three bullets. And see what I send back.
