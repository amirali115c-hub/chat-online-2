# Want Me to Show You How to Audit Your Own AI Generated Pages for Generic Versus Ownable Lines

Here is an offer I am making today. Send me a link to one of your AI generated pages. Your homepage. Your about page. A product page. Any page. And I will audit it for you. I will identify the generic lines. I will identify the ownable lines. And I will show you how to turn generic into ownable.

This is not a sales call. This is not a pitch. This is a free audit. No obligation. No follow up. Just honest feedback on your content. And a learning opportunity for both of us.

## How This Works

Step one. Send me a URL. Any page on your website. Just the link. And tell me what you think is wrong with it. What do you feel is off? What do you suspect is too generic?

Step two. I will audit the page. I will read through your content. I will identify the lines that sound like everyone else. I will identify the lines that could only come from you. And I will mark the difference.

Step three. I will send you back an audit. Not a long report. Just a clear breakdown. Generic line. Ownable line. Why the difference matters.

Step four. I will offer suggestions. How to turn each generic line into something ownable. What words to use. What patterns to follow. How to think about your brand language.

This whole process takes less than 24 hours. And it costs you nothing.

## What I Am Looking For

I am looking for pages that have potential. Pages where the business has something to offer. Pages where the AI content is just not doing the work. Pages that could be so much better with the right editing.

I am not looking for pages that are already great. Those do not need my help. I am looking for pages that are almost there. Pages that have the bones of something good. Pages that just need the right guidance to reach their potential.

If your page makes you feel something. If you know it could be better. If you have been tweaking it and not getting results. That is the page I want to see.

## Why I Am Making This Offer

I want to help. That is the simple truth. I see so many businesses struggling with AI content. They have good products. They have real expertise. They have businesses that could be growing. And they are held back by content that does not represent them.

This audit is my way of helping. A small gift. A taste of what I do. And if you like the audit and want more, great. And if you do not, you still have something useful. A clearer understanding of what needs to change.

Also, I learn from these audits. Every page I review teaches me something. About different industries. About different challenges. About different approaches to brand voice. And that learning makes me better at what I do.

## What You Get Out of It

What do you get out of this audit? Three things.

First, clarity. You will see exactly where your content is generic and why. You will see the patterns that are making your content blend in.

Second, direction. You will get specific suggestions for improvement. Not vague advice. Specific changes to specific lines.

Third, a framework. You will learn how to audit your own content going forward. You will learn what to look for. You will learn how to identify generic versus ownable.

This is not just a one time help. This is a skill you can apply to all your future content.

## The Ask

Here is what I need from you. Send me a URL. Send me a brief description of what you think is wrong. And use the subject line: Audit My Content.

I will respond within 24 hours with your audit. And we will go from there.

No obligation. No sales pressure. No follow up unless you want one. Just a free audit of your AI generated content. And a chance to see what professional editing looks like.

What do you have to lose? Send me your URL. Let us see what is possible.
