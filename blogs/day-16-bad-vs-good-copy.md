# Bad AI Copy vs Good AI Edited Copy

Let me show you something useful. I am going to compare bad AI copy with good AI edited copy in three clear columns. Phrase, vibe, and what it makes the reader think. This format is easy to screenshot and save. And it will help you see the difference between AI that blends in and AI that converts.

I have taken real examples from actual businesses. Names have been changed to protect the innocent. But the patterns are real. And the difference is dramatic. Read through these comparisons. And ask yourself which column your own AI content falls into.

## First Comparison

Bad AI Copy:

Phrase: We offer innovative solutions for forward thinking businesses

Vibe: Corporate, generic, trying too hard

What it makes the reader think: Nothing. This sounds like every other business. I will keep scrolling.

Good AI Edited Copy:

Phrase: We help businesses that are tired of average marketing get results that actually matter

Vibe: Direct, confident, experienced

What it makes the reader think: This sounds like they understand my frustration. Maybe they can actually help.

## Second Comparison

Bad AI Copy:

Phrase: Our team of experts leverages cutting edge technology to deliver transformative outcomes

Vibe: Jargon heavy, vague, impersonal

What it makes the reader think: What does any of this actually mean? What do they actually do?

Good AI Edited Copy:

Phrase: We use AI to write your content faster. We use human editors to make it convert. That combination works.

Vibe: Practical, clear, confident

What it makes the reader think: Okay, so they use AI and humans. That makes sense. What is the catch?

## Third Comparison

Bad AI Copy:

Phrase: In order to maximize your potential, it is important to note that our services are designed to help you achieve your goals

Vibe: Wordy, passive, uncertain

What it makes the reader think: This is too long. I do not know what they actually do. I am leaving.

Good AI Edited Copy:

Phrase: Most AI content is forgettable. We make content that gets remembered.

Vibe: Bold, different, memorable

What it makes the reader think: Okay, that is different. At least they have an opinion.

## Fourth Comparison

Bad AI Copy:

Phrase: One of the key benefits of working with us is our commitment to quality and excellence in everything we do

Vibe: Hedge-y, weak, forgettable

What it makes the reader think: So you are good at everything? That is not possible. What is your actual specialty?

Good AI Edited Copy:

Phrase: We are specialists. We help Dubai businesses with content. That is all we do. And we are very good at it.

Vibe: Focused, confident, clear

What it makes the reader think: Okay, they know what they are. They are not trying to be everything. That is refreshing.

## Fifth Comparison

Bad AI Copy:

Phrase: We are excited to announce our new range of products designed to meet your needs

Vibe: Generic, promotional, boring

What it makes the reader think: You are excited. That is great. But what does this actually do for me?

Good AI Edited Copy:

Phrase: We built this after watching our clients struggle with generic content. Here is what we learned and how we fixed it.

Vibe: Personal, story driven, valuable

What it makes the reader think: They actually learned from their clients. That sounds like a real solution.

## The Pattern

Look at these comparisons and you will see a clear pattern. Bad AI copy uses corporate language. It tries to sound professional but ends up sounding generic. It hedges and qualifies and dances around the point.

Good AI edited copy is direct. It has a point of view. It speaks to a specific person. And it makes the reader feel something.

That is the difference. That is what separates content that converts from content that just fills space. And that difference is created by humans editing AI output.

## Your Action Item

Take your own AI content. Run it through this test. What is the phrase? What is the vibe? What does it make the reader think? If the answers are not good, edit the content. And use these examples as a guide.
