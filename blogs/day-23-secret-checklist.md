# The Exact AI Editing Checklist I Use on Every Client

Here is something I have never shared publicly before. This is the checklist I use before I hit publish on any AI generated content. Seven questions I ask every single time. And if the content does not pass all seven questions, it goes back for another round of editing.

I developed this checklist over years of working with AI content. It started as a mental process. Then I wrote it down. Then I refined it. And now it is my secret weapon. It is how I ensure every piece of content that carries my name meets my standards.

I am going to share this checklist with you. Not because it will replace my work. Because I want you to understand what premium AI editing actually looks like. And because I know that most of you will not follow it. You will see the questions and think, that is too much work. And that is exactly why most AI content stays average. Most people are not willing to do the work that separates good from great.

## Question One: Does This Sound Like the Brand?

The first question is about voice. Does this content sound like the brand it is supposed to represent? Not similar. Not kind of close. Exactly like the brand could have written it.

Here is how I test it. I read the content out loud. And I ask, if someone read this without seeing the brand name, would they know it was from this brand? If the answer is no, I have a voice problem. The content sounds too generic. Too much like AI default language. Too little like the specific brand.

And the fix is usually simple. Replace corporate phrases with brand specific phrases. Add contractions where AI used formal language. Vary sentence length where AI was too uniform. Inject personality where AI was too flat.

## Question Two: Is Every Sentence Necessary?

The second question is about economy. Every sentence in this content should earn its place. If a sentence does not add value, it should be cut. No exceptions.

I read through every sentence and I ask, what happens if I delete this sentence? If the answer is nothing. If the meaning stays the same. If the flow does not suffer. Then the sentence goes. AI loves to add filler. It loves to pad content with extra words. And my job is to cut all of it.

This question alone will improve your AI content by 50 percent. Most AI content is at least 20 percent filler. Cutting that filler makes your content tighter, stronger, and more impactful.

## Question Three: Is the Main Message Clear?

The third question is about focus. What is the one thing the reader should remember after reading this? And is that thing clear within the first few sentences?

If I cannot answer that question easily, the content has a focus problem. AI tends to wander. It includes tangentially related information. It covers peripheral points. And that dilution kills conversion.

The fix is usually at the beginning. Tighten the opening. State the main message clearly. And make sure everything else supports that message instead of distracting from it.

## Question Four: Does This Create Emotion?

The fourth question is about impact. Will the reader feel something after reading this? Or is it emotionally flat?

AI content often lacks emotion. AI is designed to be helpful and informative. But helpful and informative is not the same as compelling and memorable. And content that does not create emotion does not create action.

So I ask, what emotions does this content create? Excitement? Curiosity? Relief? Frustration followed by hope? If the answer is nothing, I need to add emotional elements. Stories, contrasts, vivid language, personal touches. Whatever it takes to make the reader feel something.

## Question Five: Would the Target Audience Care?

The fifth question is about relevance. Would the person this content is written for actually care about reading it? Or is it written for a generic audience that does not exist?

This is where most AI content fails. It is written for everyone. And everyone is no one. Specific content for a specific audience creates engagement. Generic content for a generic audience creates nothing.

I visualize the exact person this content is for. And I ask, would they read this? Would they find it valuable? Would they share it? If the answer is no, I need to make the content more specific. More relevant. More targeted to the actual reader.

## Question Six: Does the CTA Work?

The sixth question is about conversion. If the content asks the reader to do something, does that call to action actually work? Is it clear? Is it compelling? Is it easy to do?

AI often writes weak calls to action. It says things like contact us or learn more. And those calls do not convert. Strong calls to action create urgency. They offer value. They make the next step obvious.

I test every CTA against a simple standard. Would I actually click this? If the answer is no, the CTA needs work.

## Question Seven: Did I Earn the Right to Make This Claim?

The seventh question is about credibility. Every claim in this content should be backed by evidence or experience. If I say something works, do I have proof? If I say something is true, do I have the authority to say it?

AI makes claims all the time. It states things as fact that may not be true. And that undermines credibility. So I go through every claim and I ask, is this substantiated? And if not, I either add the evidence or remove the claim.

## The Checklist in Action

This seven question checklist takes about five minutes to run on any piece of content. Five minutes that transform average AI content into premium content. Five minutes that separate the professionals from the amateurs.

Most people will not do this work. Most people will publish AI content without checking. And that is why most AI content stays average. But if you do this work. If you run this checklist. If you refuse to publish content that does not pass. Then your content will stand out. Your content will convert. And your content will build your brand.

So save this checklist. Print it out. Use it on every piece of AI content you produce. And watch the difference it makes.
