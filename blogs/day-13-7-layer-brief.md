# The Seven Layer Brief I Feed AI Before Asking It to Write for a Brand

Here is something most copywriters will not tell you. The secret to getting good AI content is not the prompt. It is the briefing. AI is only as good as what you tell it. And most people give AI terrible briefings. They give it a topic and a keyword. And then they wonder why the output is generic.

I have spent years refining my briefing process. And I want to share it with you today. This is the seven layer brief I use before I ask AI to write anything for a client. This is what turns generic AI output into brand specific content. And once you see it, you will understand why your AI content has been underperforming.

I am going to walk you through each layer. And at the end, I will give you a simplified version you can start using right away. This system works for any type of content. Blog posts, landing pages, emails, social media. If it can be written by AI, this briefing will help.

## Layer One: Who Are We Talking To

The first layer is audience definition. Before AI can write content that resonates, it needs to know who it is talking to. And no, saying small business owners is not enough. That is too broad. You need to be specific.

Here is what I tell AI. The reader is a business owner in Dubai who has been running their company for three to seven years. They have had some success but they feel stuck. They are tired of generic marketing advice that does not work in the UAE market. They want practical solutions, not theory. And they are willing to invest in help if they see clear value.

See how specific that is? That description creates a clear picture in AI's mind. It knows the reader's situation, their frustration, their desire, and their mindset. And that specificity shows up in the output.

## Layer Two: What Problem Are We Solving

The second layer is problem definition. What pain point does this content address? What frustration does it speak to? What fear does it acknowledge?

Here is an example. This content addresses the frustration of business owners who have tried AI content tools but got generic results. They spent hours tweaking prompts and still ended up with content that sounds like everyone else's. They feel like they are wasting time. They feel like AI is not for them. And this content validates that feeling and offers a solution.

When AI knows the problem deeply, it writes content that connects with that problem. Content that makes the reader feel understood. And that is the beginning of a conversion.

## Layer Three: What Is Our Position

The third layer is brand positioning. This is where you define what makes your brand different. And I do not mean features. I mean perspective. Attitude. A point of view that no one else has.

Here is what I tell AI. Our brand believes that AI is a tool, not a replacement. We believe the future belongs to humans who use AI well. We believe most AI content advice is backwards because it focuses on prompts instead of positioning. We are here to help businesses build their brand voice first and use AI second.

See how that creates a distinct perspective? That perspective infuses everything AI writes. It gives the content a point of view. And points of view are what make content memorable.

## Layer Four: What Voice Do We Use

The fourth layer is voice definition. How does your brand sound? And I do not mean professional or friendly. I mean specific patterns. What words do you use? What words do you avoid? What sentence structures do you prefer?

Here is what I tell AI. We use short sentences. We use contractions. We never use corporate jargon. We ask questions. We use fragments for emphasis. We say things like I have seen and in my experience to show we have done this work ourselves.

Those specific instructions make a huge difference. Without them, AI writes in its default formal voice. With them, AI writes in a voice that sounds like a specific person. A specific brand. And that is what you want.

## Layer Five: What Is the Desired Action

The fifth layer is conversion definition. What do you want the reader to do next? Be specific. Do you want them to download something? Book a call? Reply to an email? Visit another page?

Here is what I tell AI. We want the reader to book a consultation call. We want them to see that AI content done right is different. And we want them to take action by reaching out.

When AI knows the desired action, it writes content that builds toward that action. The whole piece becomes a journey toward conversion. Instead of just information, it becomes a sales tool.

## Layer Six: What Are We Not

The sixth layer is negative definition. What are we not? What would we never say? What kind of content would never come from our brand?

Here is what I tell AI. We are not a tech company. We do not sell AI tools. We do not promise that AI will do everything for you. We do not use pushy sales tactics. We are not formal or corporate.

Those negative definitions help AI avoid common pitfalls. They keep the content on brand. They prevent the kind of generic language that sounds like every other business.

## Layer Seven: What Is the One Thing to Remember

The seventh layer is the headline. Or rather, the one thing the reader should remember. The core message. The thesis of the piece.

Here is what I tell AI. The one thing to remember is this. AI is a multiplier, not a replacement. Use it right and you will produce better content faster than you ever could without it.

That single message anchors the entire piece. Everything else supports that main point. And that focus creates memorable content.

## The Simplified Version

Now I know that seven layers might feel overwhelming. So here is a simplified version you can use right now. Answer these five questions before you prompt AI.

Who is this for? What problem do they have? What makes us different? How should this sound? What should the reader do next?

Answer those five questions. Include your answers in your prompt. And watch your AI content improve dramatically. You do not need seven layers to get good results. You just need to tell AI more than just a topic and a keyword.
